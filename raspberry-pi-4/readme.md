# My over-engineered RaspberryPi4 home setup

As I don't want to mess with installing Python and Ansible itself, I decided to run Ansible from a Docker.

To build my Ansible image:

```sh
docker build -f ./myansible-new.Dockerfile . --tag myansible2
```

To run it:

```sh
# copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and update accordingly
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/myansible/workdir myansible2
## ...or...
./run.sh
```

# Backup tasks

To use my backup (using [Restic](https://restic.readthedocs.io/)), you have to initialize your `Restic` repository first.

Quick howto:

1. Save your Google Account Project ID in `backup_google_project_id`
2. Create Google Cloud storage bucket (I use `Coldline` availability) and set its name into `backup_google_bucket`
3. Create Service Account (use `Storage Object Admin` role), add `Key` into it, and download it as a JSON file. Save path into `backup_google_service_account_key_json`
4. Initialize your Restic repository like so:

```sh
export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=google-project-id
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=subdir/service-account-key.json
restic init -r gs:google-bucket-name:/ --verbose
# Pick your password and save it into `backup_restic_password`
```

After your Restic repo was initialized, you can run our backup task using ansible.

# Last steps

Manually add [DoH-IP-blocklists](https://github.com/dibdot/DoH-IP-blocklists) into PiHole - [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dibdot/DoH-IP-blocklists/refs/heads/master/doh-domains_overall.txt).

# Grafana

I run Grafana for my dashboards locally (in docker) and not on RaspberryPi. Everything is prepared in [tools/grafana-web-ui](tools/grafana-web-ui) folder. Just run `run.sh` and/or `stop.sh`.
